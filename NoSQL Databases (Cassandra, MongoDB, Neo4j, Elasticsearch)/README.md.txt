# NoSQL Databases Project

This project explores working with 4 popular NoSQL databases: MongoDB, Cassandra, Neo4j, and Elasticsearch.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience with the following NoSQL databases:

- MongoDB - As a representative of document-oriented databases
- Cassandra - As a representative of wide column databases
- Neo4j - As a representative of graph databases
- Elasticsearch - As a representative of textual search engines

The project is completed in Python and involves collecting data, modeling and querying each database, and performance analysis.

## Contents
The project consists of the following parts:

### MongoDB
- Collect tweets from the Sahamyab API
- Preprocess tweets - extract hashtags, replace Arabic characters
- Sample queries - finding tweets by criteria
- Aggregation examples - group users by activity, hashtag usage
- Indexing for performance

### Cassandra
- Data modeling examples for sample music dataset
- Creating keyspaces and tables
- Sample queries on song information
- Aggregation examples - statistics by genre, time period

### Neo4j
- Loading sample Lord of the Rings data
- Cypher query examples - finding character relationships
- Visualization of graph results

### Elasticsearch
- Indexing tweets with Python
- Sample searches on tweets
- Visualizations of hashtags and user activity

The report provides explanations, code snippets, and screenshots for each part.
